TouristAttractions Sample
===================================
This is a sample app that shows attractions in Orlando which I build for my talk at [Xamarin Evolve 2016](https://evolve.xamarin.com/). This app is inspired from the Android's [XYZTouristAttractions](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-XYZTouristAttractions) app written in Java. Most of the source code written in C# has been directly ported from Java. 

The app itself is modeled after a hypothetical tourist attractions app that notifies the user when they are in close proximity to
notable points of interest.
